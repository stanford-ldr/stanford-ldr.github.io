I'm David, a builder dedicated to solving global challenges and forging connections to tackle them effectively. With over seven years of leadership experience across multilateral organizations, startups, and government bodies in the US and LATAM, I specialize in merging machine learning with causal analysis to devise solutions impacting millions. Currently, I'm advancing my expertise at Stanford's School of Engineering, pursuing a master's in computational social science on a full scholarship, under the guidance of Dr. Vasilis Syrgkanis. I also hold a master's in econometrics/public policy from UC San Diego.
