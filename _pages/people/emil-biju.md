I am a Master's in Electrical Engineering student at Stanford. I previously worked for two years at Microsoft as a Data and Applied Scientist in the cybersecurity research team. My research is focused on improving the interpretability and efficiency of LLMs. At the LDR lab, I am researching methods to perform verification of LLM-generated math solutions.
