Anay is a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford, working with Amin Saberi. He completed his Ph.D. at Yale University, where he was advised by Amin Karbasi and Manolis Zampetakis.

His research focuses on machine learning under complex conditions where traditional assumptions break down. His work has two parts. First, he develops foundations for machine learning with missing and selectively observed data (spanning causal inference, limited-dependence, truncated statistics, and omissions shaped by societal biases). Second, he studies why generative AI systems (including language models) are effective and designs methods to evaluate and improve their safety.

His work has received the Best Paper Award at COLT, been featured in WIRED, and received the Sir Binay Kumar Sinha award from IIT Kanpur. He co-organizes the REFORM reading group at Stanford with Amin Saberi and Grigoris Velegkas.
