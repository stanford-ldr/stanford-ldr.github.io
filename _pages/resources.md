## Reading Group

We co-organize REFORM, a reading group focused on language-model theory, scaling, and reasoning.
See the [REFORM homepage]({% link _pages/reform.md %}) for the current plan and weekly materials.

For other related events on campus see ML lunch, [HAI events](https://hai.stanford.edu), and [SDS](https://datascience.stanford.edu) website.
